Hi Mark....just thought I would type of some notes that we can refer to at 1:30.
 
Home Page - Looks good

DONE 
About - Looks good for now, but would be great to have pictures (or pictograms....not sure what to call them, but pictures similar to what you've used in the new water database) for each of the four areas (Ag, Env., Food and Drink, Rec and Hospitality).
 
DONE
Can we move the NEWS section in front of the Services section?

DONE 
News - is it possible to somehow move those seven new documents (links) associated with fee schedule links and forms to the Services section....somewhere?  Sorry.....it just doesn't feel right to have that information in the News section.
 
DONE
Services - Can we move this after the News section?  If we can, we would have to change the order of the buttons at the top of the page.  If you do find some picture-type icons in the "About: section, could we include those pictures in this section as well?
 
Gallery - Looks good.
 
Contact Us - Can we link our address pin to Google Map?  DONE
Can we make our email address a live link?  - DONE
Phone number is missing a 5 at the end (2035) - DONE
